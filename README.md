# Hydroponics Growth Sync
A mod for RimWorld that synchronizes plants growing in hydroponics to make them grow to maturity at the same time.

The plant syncing code used in this mod was heavily based on the plant syncing code used in **[Plant Growth Sync](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1454228967&searchtext=plant+growth+sync) by Lanilor.**
